Three pages contain code to process, analyse and create figures:

* [QC](QC.html) processes count tables (available at GEO####): filter high quality cells; normalize and scale counts.   
* [MOFA aIg](MOFAaIg.html) computes a model of cells stimulates with aIg molecule.   
* [MOFA ibru](MOFAibru.html) computes a model of cells stimulates with aIg molecule with or without prescence of ibrutinib.
